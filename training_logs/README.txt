this contains the training logs for YOLOv8-OBB Large, on Google Colab on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, using 10GB VRAM on average. The model was trained for 45 epochs (mAP50 of 0.85 and mAP50-95 of 0.68), and acheived relatively stable performance, however training for longer (100 epochs) may yield 5-10% improvement.(mAP50 >0.90 and mAP50-95 >0.70)
